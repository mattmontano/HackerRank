-- Below are attempts at solving the HackerRank "Occupations" problem for SQL

-- FIRST ATTEMPT:
WITH temp AS(
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN occupation = 'Doctor' THEN name
        END,
        CASE
            WHEN occupation = 'Professor' THEN name
        END,
        CASE
            WHEN occupation = 'Singer' THEN name
        END,
        CASE
            WHEN occupation = 'Actor' THEN name
        END
    FROM occupations
)
SELECT *
FROM temp;

-- This first attempt successfully creates a CTE with columns for each of the occupations
-- When selecting all, NULL is filled in under each occupation where the occupation does not match for each column
-- Need to figure out a way to limit the amount of rows to be the maximum number of the most popular occupation
-- Names will also have to be ordered alphabetically
-- SECOND ATTEMPT will try to use four separate CTEs, one for eah occupation, and order those names alphabetically for each CTE
